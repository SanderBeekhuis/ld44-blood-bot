*Description:*
In this game you are a blood hunting machine. Collect as much blood as possible from the last humans of earth. When the humans hit you you will lose blood, but shooting them will cost you blood as well. 

During the game enemies will spawn faster and become stronger, luckily your reload rate goes down as well. How long can you survive?

My high score was 780 units of blood in level 16.

*Controls:* 
W, A, S, D to move
Left click for a normal attack.
Right click for a special attack

Tips:
- When in a tight spot you can use your special attack
- Pick up blood before it dissapears into the ground. Without blood you die.

Developers notes:
Unforunaly I was only able to work on this game alone and for just two days. Due to a national holiday in the Netherlands I really wanted to join. So this is just a first entry. Hopefully I will be able to deliver more next Ludum Dare.

I had a lot of fun with the theme and when I began the game I envisioned some sort of upgrade shop. But now life is currency in the sense that you have to pay for every shot you make.

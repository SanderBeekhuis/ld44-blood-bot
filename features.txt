NOT THAT IMPORTANT
- beter background image (more consistent with the art style, if i can figure out what the artstyle is)
- Better Music (More industrial?)
- Splash screen
- knoback and flash on being hit? Is this a good idea?
- improve on overblood graphic. I want it to look like a swirling mass of blood drops
- level up notification (visual)
- Better death experience. First pause (and maybe gray out) game, before scene change
- Nice font and text in the game over screen and in the gui

LARGE
- Keep some of your progress when restarting?
- Somehow buy upgrades from gatherd blood or something
